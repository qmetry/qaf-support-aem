  * Check Whether Page Present
  * Create page
  * Open page
  * Add component
  * Publish page
  * Delete page
  * Copy an existing
 
In-built steps (AEMAuthoringSteps.java) are available to achieve above functionality to use in BDD or in Code. 

* To create, copy, move, delete page in-built steps uses [aem-testing-clients](https://github.com/adobe/aem-testing-clients) which is stable maintained by adobe team and works with any version of AEM.  If you want to use UI to create/delete/move page you can use AEMSitesPage.  
* In order to open page, add component and validate functionality you automate through UI using AEMEditorPage.
